### Project Overview

This project, completed for PHYS 242 - Electronics under Prof. Jason Stalnaker, involved creating a 4-leg spider-like robot capable of intricate movements using 12 SG90 servo motors. Equipped with an Arduino Nano microcontroller and an OLED screen displaying a customizable face, the robot combines mechanical precision and visual appeal. The project emphasizes control, design, and circuit layout.

### Design Goals

1. **Enhanced Motion Control**: Unlike simpler, wheel-based robots, this project challenges balance and movement by individually controlling 12 joints for a wide range of motion.
2. **Customization**: Programmed a personalized bitmap face on the OLED screen, inspired by prior experiments with LCD displays.
3. **Circuit Prototyping**: Built a circuit on a zero PCB board to understand layout and soldering, ensuring efficient accommodation of all components.

### Circuit Design

#### Power Regulation
The voltage regulator circuit steps down the 7.4V from the LiPo battery to a stable 5V for the Arduino Nano and servos. Using the IC7805 with a 0.1ÂµF ceramic capacitor ensures smooth power delivery while eliminating noise.

#### Servo Motor Integration
Each SG90 servo motor operates on PWM signals for precise positioning. Servos are labeled and connected as follows:

| Label   | Arduino Pin | Label   | Arduino Pin |
|---------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| FLF     | D4          | BLF     | D10         |
| FLK     | D3          | BLK     | D9          |
| FLH     | D2          | BLH     | D8          |
| FRF     | D7          | BRF     | A3          |
| FRK     | D6          | BRK     | A2          |
| FRH     | D5          | BRH     | A1          |

#### OLED Screen
The OLED uses SPI communication, requiring specific connections for clock (SCL), data (SDA), chip select (CS), and data/command (DC). This setup enables dynamic facial expressions to be displayed.

### Testing and Assembly

- **Mechanical Parts**: All feet, knees, hips, and the main body were 3D printed using PLA. Assembly required careful alignment to ensure proper motion.  
- **Calibration**: Each servo was tested and adjusted to avoid strain or overheating. Replacement servos were used for those that failed during testing.  
- **Prototyping**: Breadboard connections were used to synchronize servos, and soldering was performed for essential components like the voltage regulator and OLED headers.
