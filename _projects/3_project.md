# Autonomous Navigation with Deep Reinforcement Learning on TurtleBot3

Welcome to the project hub for our exploration of **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** in autonomous navigation using the **TurtleBot3 Burger**. 

Our work has two key objectives: **obstacle avoidance** and **dynamic target following**. By integrating DRL with robust frameworks like PyTorch, we aim to improve the robotâ€™s decision-making in real-time scenarios.

## About the Project

### Problem Statement
Navigating dynamic and cluttered environments autonomously remains a challenging problem for robots.

### Objectives
- Implement **DRL** for real-time **obstacle avoidance** by [van Rietbergen T.L](https://github.com/tomasvr/turtlebot3_drlnav) for LD08 sensor.  
- Enable **dynamic target following** while maintaining the first feature.  

### Motivation
This research addresses critical challenges in robotics and contributes to practical applications in service robots, autonomous vehicles, and other areas.

## Research Methodology

### Robot Platform
- **TurtleBot3 Burger**: Compact, ROS-compatible, ideal for research and education.

### Software Stack
- **ROS**: Robot Operating System for communication and control.  
- **PyTorch**: Framework for developing DRL models.  
- **Gazebo**: Simulation environment for testing.

### Approach
1. **Simulations**: Training DRL models in controlled virtual environments.  
2. **Real-world Testing**: Refining models on the physical TurtleBot3.  

### Challenges
