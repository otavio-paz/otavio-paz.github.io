## **The Problem: Combating Brazilian Spotted Fever**

Brazilian spotted fever, a deadly tick-borne disease, saw a concerning rise in cases during my high school years in Salto, SP. Recognizing the urgent need for action, the Biological Institute of São Paulo hosted a seminar highlighting the dangers of tick infestations and best practices for mitigation. Inspired by this knowledge, I sought to design a practical tool that could address this issue effectively, blending innovation with science.

## **Our Methods: A Collaborative and Scientific Approach**

### **Fieldwork with Experts**
To develop a comprehensive solution, I collaborated with biologists during field trips to learn how ticks are captured. These real-world insights formed the foundation for designing an effective trapping tool.

### **Attraction Mechanisms**
Through experiments, we compared the tick-attraction efficacy of:
- Dry ice
- CO₂ cylinders
- A chemical reaction using calcium carbonate and lactic acid.

The chemical reaction proved both efficient and practical, serving as the core of our system.

### **Engineering the Solution**
- **Electrocuting Mechanism**: Reverse-engineered an electric fly swatter to increase voltage output and designed it to operate independently of batteries.
- **Designing the Trap**: Proposed a metallic mesh structure that separated ticks by life stages for targeted control.
- **Prototyping**: Using SolidWorks, I designed the model in 3D CAD and fabricated the prototype from acrylic, ensuring durability and functionality.

## **Results: From Prototype to Real-World Impact**

Our system demonstrated remarkable success:
- **Eradication**: Achieved 100% tick eradication in controlled lab settings.
- **Sustainability**: Designed a solar-powered circuit using a 115W panel, making the device energy-efficient.
- **Innovation Recognition**: Submitted a patent application, securing our position as a pioneer in sustainable tick control solutions.

## **Future Goals: Scaling and Innovating**

With promising results in hand, we aim to:
1. **Miniaturize the Device**: Make it more portable and user-friendly.
2. **Integrate IoT Features**: Enable remote monitoring and control for improved usability.
3. **Test in Open Areas**: Validate its effectiveness in larger, real-world environments.
4. **Secure Funding**: Apply for grants to accelerate development and deployment.

## **Conclusion**

Papa Tick represents the intersection of biology, engineering, and innovation, offering a sustainable solution to a critical public health problem. With a commitment to refinement and scaling, we strive to make this device a global standard in tick infestation management.
