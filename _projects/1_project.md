## **The Problem: Combating Brazilian Spotted Fever**

Brazilian spotted fever, a deadly tick-borne disease, saw a concerning rise in cases during my high school years in Salto, SP. Recognizing the urgent need for action, the Biological Institute of São Paulo hosted a seminar highlighting the dangers of tick infestations and best practices for mitigation. Inspired by this knowledge, I sought to design a practical tool that could address this issue with a team of friends at Instituto Federal de São Paulo.

## **Our Methods:**

### **Fieldwork with Experts**

To develop a comprehensive solution, we collaborated with biologists from Biological Institute of São Paulo. During field trips to learn how ticks are captured. These real-world insights formed the foundation for designing the Papa Tick.

### **Attraction Mechanisms**

Through experiments, we compared the tick-attraction efficacy of:

- Dry ice
- CO₂ cylinders
- A chemical reaction using calcium carbonate and lactic acid.

The dry ice and CO₂ cylinders proved to be the best options for attracting ticks. Specially the dry ice, due to its low-cost.

### **Engineering the Solution**

- **Electrocuting Mechanism**: Reverse-engineered an electric fly swatter to increase voltage output and designed it to operate with a constant voltage.
- **Designing the Trap**: Proposed a metallic mesh structure that separated ticks by life stages for targeted control.
- **Prototyping**: Using SolidWorks, I designed the model in 3D CAD and fabricated the prototype from acrylic, ensuring durability.

## **Results:**

Our system demonstrated remarkable success:

- **Eradication**: Achieved 100% tick eradication in controlled lab settings.
- **Sustainability**: Designed a solar-powered circuit using a 115W panel, making the device energy-efficient.
- **Innovation Recognition**: Submitted a patent application, securing our position as a pioneer in sustainable tick control solutions.

## **Future Goals: Scaling and Innovating**

With promising results in hand, after getting the patent approval, we aim to:

1. **Miniaturize the Device**: Make it more portable and user-friendly.
2. **Integrate IoT Features**: Enable remote monitoring and control for improved usability.
3. **Test in Open Areas**: Validate its effectiveness in larger, real-world environments.
4. **Secure Funding**: Apply for grants to accelerate development and deployment.

## **Conclusion**

Papa Tick represents the intersection of biology, engineering, and innovation, offering a sustainable solution to a critical public health problem. With a commitment to refinement and scaling, we hope to make this device an effective tool in tick infestation management.
