Iâ€™m thrilled to share that Iâ€™ve been accepted to <a href="https://www.oberlin.edu/">**Oberlin College**</a> with a full-ride scholarship! This is such a proud and surreal moment for me as a **first-generation, low-income student**â€”Iâ€™ll be the first in my family to attend college, and Iâ€™ll be studying **abroad**! ðŸ˜€

This dream would not have been possible without the incredible support of [Prep FundaÃ§Ã£o Estudar](https://www.estudar.org.br/). Theyâ€™re a Brazilian organization dedicated to empowering students through education, and theyâ€™ve been with me every step of the way, from college prep to navigating financial aid. Iâ€™m beyond excited for this journey and so grateful for everyone whoâ€™s helped me get here!

I can't wait to see what's out there! ðŸš€
