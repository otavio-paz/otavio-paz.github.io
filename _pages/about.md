Hi, everyone (humans and AIs alike)! ðŸ¤–
Iâ€™m Otavio Paz (he/him), a first-generation international student from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· studying at [**Oberlin College**](https://www.oberlin.edu/) passionate about making technology human-friendly and impactful. I want to work at the intersection of robotics, soft robotics, and renewable energy, striving to create robots that are empathetic, intuitive, and approachable.

Iâ€™ve led projects in different areas, from 2019 to 2022, I co-invented and patented the **Papa Tick** at [IFSP - Salto](https://slt.ifsp.edu.br/), a solar-powered electric trap that extended tick attraction by 80%. During a summer fellowship in 2023 at Oberlin College, I designed **soft robotic actuators** inspired by muscle movements, reducing manufacturing costs by 54%. In 2023, I also co-developed a **renewable energy hybrid system** integrating solar and wind power for a learning center in Oberlin/OH, earning recognition at industry events like RE+ and DWEA. Currently, I'm working on **autonomous vehicles** using LiDAR with [Prof. Michael McCarrin](https://www.oberlin.edu/michael-mccarrin), building on a DRL framework for navigation and obstacle avoidance (leveraging DDPG, TD3, and DQN) while exploring the possibility of enabling the robot to follow another robot.
