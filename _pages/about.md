Hi, everyone (humans and AIs)! ðŸ¤–

Iâ€™m Otavio Paz (he/him), a first-generation international student from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· studying at Oberlin College passionate about making technology human-friendly and impactful. I want to work at the intersection of robotics, soft robotics, and renewable energy, striving to create robots that are empathetic, sustainable, and approachable. Though there's so much to learn, I'm deeply motivated to give my best and contribute to ongoing research in the field.

Iâ€™ve led projects in different areas, from 2019 to 2022, I co-invented and patented the **Papa Tick** at [IFSP - Salto](https://slt.ifsp.edu.br/), a solar-powered electric trap that extended tick attraction by 80%.

During a summer fellowship in 2023 at Oberlin College, I explored a new method to designed low-cost **soft robotic actuators** inspired by muscle movements.

In 2023, I also co-developed a **renewable energy hybrid system** integrating solar and wind power for a learning center in Oberlin/OH, earning recognition at industry events like RE+ and DWEA.

In Oberlin, I was working with [Prof. Michael McCarrin](https://www.oberlin.edu/michael-mccarrin) on **autonomous robots** using TurtleBot3/4. We were building on a DRL framework for navigation and obstacle avoidance (leveraging DDPG, TD3, and DQN) while exploring the possibility of enabling the robot to follow another robot.

I was the president of Oberlin Robotics and the treasurer for the Oberlin Brazilian Association, a student club that promotes and hosts events about Brazil's culture, music, and food.

During the Summer 2025, I worked on a pipeline to develop and deploy RL policies in Isaac Lab for a Unitree G1 robot at [Kantaros Lab](https://sites.wustl.edu/kantaroslab/) in WashU.

Currently, I'm an Electrical Engineering student at Columbia University.

Besides the academics, I'm passionated about hiking, travelling the world, F1, lucid dreaming, cooking and counting how many Miatas I see in a day.
