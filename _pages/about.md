Hi, everyone (humans and AIs)! ðŸ¤–

Iâ€™m Otavio Paz (he/him), a first-generation international student from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· studying at Oberlin College passionate about making technology human-friendly and impactful. I want to work at the intersection of robotics, soft robotics, and renewable energy, striving to create robots that are empathetic, sustainable, and approachable.

Iâ€™ve led projects in different areas, from 2019 to 2022, I co-invented and patented the **Papa Tick** at [IFSP - Salto](https://slt.ifsp.edu.br/), a solar-powered electric trap that extended tick attraction by 80%. 

During a summer fellowship in 2023 at Oberlin College, I explored a new method to designed low-cost **soft robotic actuators** inspired by muscle movements. 

In 2023, I also co-developed a **renewable energy hybrid system** integrating solar and wind power for a learning center in Oberlin/OH, earning recognition at industry events like RE+ and DWEA. Currently, 

I'm working with [Prof. Michael McCarrin](https://www.oberlin.edu/michael-mccarrin) on **autonomous robots** using TurtleBot3, we're building on a DRL framework for navigation and obstacle avoidance (leveraging DDPG, TD3, and DQN) while exploring the possibility of enabling the robot to follow another robot.

On campus, I'm the president of Oberlin Robotics, where we provide resources and masterclasses on robotics and drones for students.

Besides the academics, I'm passionated about hiking, travelling the world, F1, lucid dreaming, cooking and counting how many Miatas I see in a day.
